# Predict League of legends winning game
League Of Legends This is a game about 5-champion versus 5-champion that needs to destroying the rival team’s nexus.
At this Project I built 4 Classification models for predict which group will win (Blue Or Red) using 
some parameters, that I chose by heatmap.
Alot of people tried to predict LOL game winning, but I going to show you by simple models how you can do it by yourself.
